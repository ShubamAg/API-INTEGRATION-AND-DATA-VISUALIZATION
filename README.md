## Task Description-->
In this task, I developed a Python script that integrates with a public API, specifically OpenWeatherMap, to fetch real-time weather data for a given city. The primary goal was to extract meaningful weather insights and visualize them using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The program sends requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves data like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed. This data is then parsed and formatted using the JSON response structure. After successful data retrieval, the program stores and processes the weather statistics, particularly focusing on patterns throughout the day.

For visualization, I created line charts and bar plots to represent the temperature trend over time. These graphs help users visually understand how weather conditions vary by hour or day. Additionally, I added interactive features like zooming for detailed views of particular time ranges.

This task enhanced my understanding of:

How APIs work and how to fetch data from them using the requests library.

How to preprocess and clean the data for better insights.

How to build effective visual dashboards using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

This project is a great example of integrating real-world data with visual storytelling, and it's easily extensible for any API or dataset.
